# System Programming in C â€“ Exercises and Projects

This repository contains a collection of hands-on exercises, lab assignments, and experiments in **System Programming using C**. The code is designed to deepen understanding of low-level concepts such as process management, memory allocation, file systems, sockets, threads, and basic security flaws (like buffer overflows).

## Topics Covered

- Memory Management (heap, stack)
- Process Creation (`fork`, `exec`, `wait`)
- Threading with `pthread`
- Inter-Process Communication (pipes, sockets)
- File I/O (POSIX)
- Networking basics with TCP sockets
- Basic exploit development (e.g., buffer overflow)
- Signal handling
- Makefile usage
- Working in WSL/Linux environment

## Project Structure
/project_name/ # Each folder is a standalone task or lab

## How to Run

Make sure you have a working **C compiler** (like `gcc`) and are running on **Linux or WSL**.
